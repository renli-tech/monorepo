# monorepo
A template for monorepo projects

> The word monorepo is a combination between “mono”, as in the Greek word mónos (in translation, alone) and an abbreviation of the word repository. A simple concept if taken verbatim: one lonely repository. The domain is software engineering so we’re referring to a home for source code, multimedia assets, binary files, and so on. But this definition is just the tip of the iceberg, since a monorepo in practice is so much more.
